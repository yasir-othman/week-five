I decided to install ubuntu 16.04.3 image, after I tried to run tails and debian they seemed not compatible with Windows Os, it was hard for me to make it persistence. that when I switched to Ubuntu, I was able to make it persistence just by using simple app "universal usb installer", so these are the steps I followed to install the image:-



1- install ubuntu image from the ubuntu website on your labtop.
	What you need to do first is get Ubuntu.  You can use either a CD or an ISO CD image 		downloaded from the Internet. " https://www.ubuntu.com/download"

2- install "universall usb installer" which will allow you to copy the image on your USB drive 
   and will give you the option to make it persistence.

3- after that try to restat your computer and change the booting option to your USB drive option.


4- after you lunch your image you can go to search your computer icon " left top" and type in      	"GPARTED" it is apartition editor will allow you to make partitions on your thumb drive.

5- Also if you seeking more info you can visit this website which has more helpful details just 	type in the link in your URL.
